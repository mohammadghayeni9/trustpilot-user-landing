									was very apprehensive flying with this
									airline after reading reviews, however I had
									the best experience with them; flew from
									Edinburgh to Antalya return, both flights
									left on time and arrived early; on the
									outbound flight it was a pretty new plane
									with extremely comfortable seats, the plane
									was quiet and the female team member came
									and offered me a row on my own ! Great
									flight and no intrusive duty free sales -
									staff came round with refreshments twice, so
									you weren&#x27;t being constantly hassled :)
									Return flight was an older plane, but still
									very comfortable, more legroom than
									competitors, and again a seat which
									didn&#x27;t leave you with backache at the
									end of the flight, also boarding was a
									breeze as they allow plenty time, and there
									were literally no queues, maybe I was lucky,
									but I was well impressed - and also 20kilo
									luggage included is a big bonus - this is my
									new favourite budget airline
